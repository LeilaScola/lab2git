Hello. My name is Leila Scola. I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at SCU. I am a senior. In my free time I enjoy cooking, baking, and hiking. Learning new things is something I really enjoy doing.

This quarter I am taking software engineering, operating systems, and senior design.
