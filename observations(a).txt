After typing "git init", the console read "Implementing Multi-Threaded Processes Using Kernel Threads"

After typing "git status", the console read "# On branch master

After creating "aboutMe.txt" and typing "git status", it reads

After using git commit and inserting my comment, the console displayed the following message
"[master (root-commit) 1122717] Here's the new file
 Committer: leila a scola <lscola@linux10615.dc.engr.scu.edu>
Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 aboutMe.txt"

After adding the new file, this is what happens after git status
"# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	allstaff.txt
#	observations.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)"


After making changes to aboutMe.txt and typing git status, this appeared
"# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   aboutMe.txt
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	observations.txt"

After committing the changes, the console read 
"[master b4ca7cc] made some changes
 Committer: leila a scola <lscola@linux10615.dc.engr.scu.edu>

on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

If I add a third file to the folder and don't want it to be tracked by git, I will not add it or commit. This can be seen with my observations.txt file.
